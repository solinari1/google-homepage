Brief intro:

I've begun my coding journey 3 days ago without any prior knowledge of programming whatsoever.
This is my first attempt at (re-)creating something.

The goal of this project is to create the Google.com using what I learned about HTML/CSS.

This project is inspired by The Odin Project. More info can be found on their website:
